      "text": "FAQ\n\n1. What happens when I narrowcast?\n> Normally, when you cast in a channel it goes out to all of your followers—regardless of whether they follow the channel. So if you’re a /diet-coke enthusiast, all of your followers will see your silly casts about caffeine in their home feeds, even if they prefer /coffee or Pepsi. But with narrowcasts, you can limit your casts to only followers of /diet-coke.\n\nNote: this is a Warpcast-only behavior for now. Other clients are free adopt or disregard this.\n\n2. Are narrowcasts part of the protocol?\n> No. They’re an experiment.\n\n3. How long will you run the experiment?\n> For a couple weeks. If it has low usage, we will likely remove. If usage looks good, we’ll work on incorporating into the protocol.\n\n4. I want to see all casts from everyone I follow even if they narrowcast but I don’t want to follow every channel!\n> Try using another client like @supercast or @herocast",
